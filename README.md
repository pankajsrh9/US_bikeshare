### Project Title
Bikeshare analysis using python

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

So, in this project, I will make use of Python to analyse data of bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Files used
chicago.csv, new york city.csv and washington.csv
